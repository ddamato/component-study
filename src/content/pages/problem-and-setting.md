The Problem and Its Setting An overview of the study is found in the first two paragraphs. Why you find the topic interesting; what the topic is about; what the background of the study is.

Statement of the Problem (1 paragraph)
What you wish to inquire into - the three objectives Note: Refer to the subordinate questions.

Significance of the Study (1 paragraph)
Why the topic is important; of what use the topic is, to whom; how people will benefit in the study

Limitations of the Study (1 paragraph)
Who are the respondents, when and where; what you can and will do; what you will not do/include)

The fundamental question this study aims to answer is "what is a component?" in terms of digital application authorship.

This topic is important not only in application discourse but more importantly measurement. We cannot count what is not clearly defined. If and when this question is answered, application authors will be able to measure adoption of these components more accurately and determine overall impact in comparison to the application as a whole. This work aims to justify the purpose of component authors and maintainers.

This study will refer to experts in either design or development phase of application authorship. This study may also refer to professionals tangentially related to the practice of manufacturing with composable patterns outside of the digital domain. The study expects to include questions that raise discussions about how our industry expects measurement of components to behave if this aligns with how these components exist within our frame of reference inside an application.
